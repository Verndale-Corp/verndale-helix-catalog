	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for making URL Redirects easy to maintain within Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
Compatible with Sitecore 9.1
Requires Sitecore 9.1
Requires .NET Framework 4.7.1

Verndale Helix Catalog is a collection of utilities for the Sitecore .NET CMS.
The Feature.Redirects library solves the frequently occurring problem of managing a collection of urls that must be redirected to other urls. Current solutions involve IIS URL Rewrite module, which is not author-friendly, and using Sitecore Aliases, which is not scalable. The application is accessed from within the Sitcore desktop and uses Sitecore's native Sheer UI components.

Redirect rules are implemented through an HttpRequestBegin Pipeline processor that reviews would-be 404 requests for matching redirects and handles the response if there is a match.

Note: This version uses an Item Bucket and the Search Index to store redirects. The redirect pipeline queries the MASTER search index.

Installation
1. Add this NuGet package to a web application project in your Sitecore solution.
2. Build and Deploy your project to a target environment.

This library requires a Sitecore Package (included). The package should install automatically when you build and deploy your project.
