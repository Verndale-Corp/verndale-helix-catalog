	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for making URL Redirects easy to maintain within Sitecore.</summary>
	<description>
Verndale Helix Catalog is a collection of utilities for the Sitecore .NET CMS.
The Feature.Redirects library solves the frequently occurring problem of managing a collection of urls that must be redirected to other urls. Current solutions involve
IIS URL Rewrite module, which is not author-friendly, and using Sitecore Aliases, which is not scalable. This package uses a very small custom database to maintain
the list of rewrite rules. The application is accessed from within the Sitcore desktop and uses Sitecore's native Sheer UI components.
		
Redirect rules are implemented through an HttpRequestBegin Pipeline processor that reviews would-be 404 requests for matching redirects and handles the response if
there is a match

Installation
1. Add this NuGet package to a web application project in your Sitecore solution.
2. Build and Deploy your project to a target environment

This library requires a Sitecore Package (included). The package should install automatically when you build and deploy your project.

Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
