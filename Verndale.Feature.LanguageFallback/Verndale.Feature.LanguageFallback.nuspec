	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for building out static navigation that doesn't necessarily reflect the shape or names of Items in the content tree.</summary>
	<description>
Verndale Feature is a collection of utilities for the Sitecore .NET CMS.
The Feature.LanguageFallback library contains a number of user efficiency enhancements for Sitecore's Language Fallback feature.
		
* Language Fallback Report allows you to see which Items are falling back to which languages.
* Language Migration allows you to migrate content from one database/language to another.
* Culture Resolver, which is installed in the HttpRequestBeginPipeline ensures that your System CurrentCulture matches your Sitecore Language.
* Default Site Language Resolver, also in the HttpRequestBeginPipeline changes Sitecore's default language resolution strategy such that URLs that do not contain
		a language flag will be configured to serve the site's default language.
* AlternateLanguageLinksController will populate your HTML Header with canonical (local) links for the current Item in all languages supported by the context site.
* The Developer Ribbon supports controls that allow the user to quickly manage Language Fallback on an entire branch of the content tree as well as enforce the
		creation of alternate language versions.


Configured for use with Sitecore 9.0.
Requires Sitecore 9.0 NuGet packages, available here: https://sitecore.myget.org/F/sc-packages/api/v3/index.json
