	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for building out static navigation that doesn't necessarily reflect the shape or names of Items in the content tree.</summary>
	<description>
Verndale Feature is a collection of utilities for the Sitecore .NET CMS.
The Feature.Redirects library solves the frequently occurring problem of managing a collection of urls that must be redirected to other urls. Current solutions involve
IIS URL Rewrite module, which is not author-friendly, and using Sitecore Aliases, which is not scalable. This package uses a very small custom database to maintain
the list of rewrite rules. The application is accessed from within the Sitcore desktop and uses Sitecore's native Sheer UI components.
