			<!-- 
			Custom Site Attribute: notFoundPageID
			
			This should be the ID of the Item to use for presenting 404 Response Status messages to the visitor.
			Each site requires its own 404 page Item. The Item must also contain a rendering or reference to the
			Verndale.Foundation.PageNotFound.Controllers.NotFoundStatusCodeController which will set the Not Found
			status in the Response. If you don't do this, the Browser will receive a 200 response code.
			
			Example Follows:
			
			<site name="website">
				<patch:attribute name="notFoundPageID">{11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111}</patch:attribute>
			</site>-->

			<!--  USE SERVER-SIDE REDIRECT FOR REQUEST ERRORS
			
			Overwrite the default value (false) because the Redirect Manager needs to use Server.Transfer instead of Response.Redirect 
			to redirect request to service pages when an error occurs (item not found, access denied etc).
			This will allow the Redirect Manager to set an appropriate response code.
