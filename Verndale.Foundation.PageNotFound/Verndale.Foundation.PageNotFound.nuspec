	<summary>Sitecore Helix library for managing site-specific 404 pages.</summary>
	<description>
Compatible with Sitecore 9.1
Requires Sitecore 9.1
Requires .NET Framework 4.7.1

Verndale Helix Catalog is a collection of utilities for the Sitecore .NET CMS.
The Foundation.PageNotFound library centralizes control of 404 pages and the process of redirecting to those 404 pages.

Installation
1. Add this NuGet package to your Sitecore solution
2. Build and Deploy your solution to a target environment

Package Includes:


Custom Site Attribute: notFoundPageID

This attribute should be set to the ID of the Item to use for presenting 404 Response Status messages to the visitor.
Each site requires its own 404 page Item. The Item must also contain a rendering or reference to the
Verndale.Foundation.PageNotFound.Controllers.NotFoundStatusCodeController which will set the Not Found
status in the Response. If you don't do this, the Browser will receive a 200 response code.


HttpRequestBegin Pipeline Processor: Page Not Found Resolver

Assuming the site is configured with the ID of the "not found page" this processor will resolve the context item
to that specific item if the context item is currently null.

This processor must run after all Site, Database, Language, and Item resolvers, but before Device and Layout resolvers.
The supplied patch:before is a safe bet, but may need to be changed depending on your solution.

Please note that this processor will only run for databases and sites as configured, and should intentionally not
run for Sitecore system sites.



HttpRequestEnd Pipeline Processor: Set404StatusCode

Assuming the site is configured with the ID of the "not found page" this processor will detect that the context item
is the 404 page and will add the 404 code to the Response.

Please note that the customizations in this processor will only run for databases and sites as configured, and should intentionally not
run for Sitecore system sites.
